The rapid evolution of scientific fields introduces challenges in organizing and retrieving scientific literature. While expert-curated taxonomies have traditionally addressed this need, the process is time-consuming and expensive. Furthermore, recent automatic taxonomy construction methods either (1) over-rely on a specific corpus, sacrificing generalizability, or (2) depend heavily on the general knowledge of large language models (LLMs) contained within their pre-training datasets, often overlooking the dynamic nature of evolving scientific domains. Additionally, these approaches fail to account for the multi-faceted nature of scientific literature, where a single research paper may contribute to multiple dimensions (e.g., methodology, new tasks, evaluation metrics, benchmarks). To address these gaps, we propose TaxoAdapt, a framework that dynamically adapts an LLM-generated taxonomy to a given corpus across multiple dimensions. TaxoAdapt performs iterative hierarchical classification, expanding both the taxonomy width and depth based on corpus' topical distribution. We demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance across a diverse set of computer science conferences over the years to showcase its ability to structure and capture the evolution of scientific fields. As a multidimensional method, TaxoAdapt generates taxonomies that are 26.51% more granularity-preserving and 50.41% more coherent than the most competitive baselines judged by LLMs.

## Setup
We use `python=3.8`, `torch=2.4.0`, and a two NVIDIA RTX A6000s. Other packages can be installed using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```
python main.py
```
### Arguments
The following are the primary arguments for TaxoAdapt (defined in main.py; modify as needed):

- `topic` $\rightarrow$ this is the topic of the corpus, e.g., "natural language processing", "robotics", etc.
- `dataset` $\rightarrow$ this is the name of the dataset, e.g., "llm_graph", "icra_2020", etc. The huggingface dataset should be added to the `construct_dataset` function in `main.py` (see below).
- `llm` $\rightarrow$ this is the LLM to be used for initial taxonomy construction, e.g., "gpt", "vllm", etc. You can replace the vLLM model in the `initializeLLM` function and the GPT model version in the `promptGPT` function of `model_definitions.py`.
- `max_depth` $\rightarrow$ this is the maximum depth of each taxonomy to be constructed.
- `init_levels` $\rightarrow$ this is the number of initial levels to be constructed in the initial taxonomy.
- `max_density` $\rightarrow$ this is the maximum density of papers to be mapped to a node (or unmapped papers at a parent node) in the taxonomies. If a leaf node has more than `max_density` papers, it will trigger depth expansion at that node. If a parent node has more than `max_density` papers that are unmapped to any of its children, it will trigger width expansion at that node.

In `main.py`, we define the different dimensions of research for a specific topic, each of which will be constructed as a separate taxonomy. You can modify the dimensions in the `args.dimensions` list.

## Custom Dataset
To use a custom dataset, you need to add it to the `construct_dataset` function in `main.py`. You may add it as follows:

```python
elif args.dataset == 'dataset_name':
        ds = load_dataset("huggingface_dataset_name")
```
We assume that the dataset has a `title` and `abstract` field for each paper. If not, you can modify the function to extract the relevant fields from your dataset.
