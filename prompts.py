quant_width_instruction = lambda node, candidate_subtopics, existing: f"""You are attempting to identify subtopics for parent topic, {node.label}, that best represent and partition a pool of papers. A subtopic is a specific division within a broader category that organizes related items or concepts more precisely.
We define {node.label} (a type of {node.dimension}) as: {node.description}

The parent topic already has the following {node.dimension} subtopics (existing_subtopics), so your chosen subtopics should expand upon the current list:

existing_subtopics: {existing}

You have the following candidate subtopics with their corresponding number of papers:

{candidate_subtopics}


Given the above set of candidate subtopics as reference, can you identify the non-overlapping cluster subtopics of parent {node.dimension} topic {node.label} that best represent and partition all of the candidates above (maximize the number of papers that are mapped to each). They should all be siblings of each other and the existing_subtopics (same level of depth/specificity) within the taxonomy (no cluster subtopic should fall under another cluster subtopic)? Each new cluster topic that you suggest should be a more specific subtopic under the parent topic node, {node.label}, and be a type of task. However, they should all be equally unique (non-duplicates) and no single paper should be able to fall into both clusters easily.

Treat this as a quantitative clustering (optimization) problem. Select subtopics that MINIMIZE the TOTAL NUMBER of subtopics needed yet simultaneously MAXIMIZE the number of total papers mapped (where the maximum value possible is the total number of papers which do not fall under existing_subtopics). In the tags <quantitative_reasoning></quantitative_reasoning>, explain your quantitative reasoning, using the candidate subtopics as variables with their integer values equal to the number of papers mapped to the respective topics. REMEMBER that all candidate subtopics under a cluster you form SHOULD BE RELATED.

Here are two example inputs and outputs:

<example_1>

x_8: entity_classification (20) # we are not considering entity_classification in any clusters since it is already contained within an existing subtopic, named_entity_recognition.

Step 2: Semantic Clustering
Cluster 1 (S_1): x_1 (sentiment_analysis), x_3 (emotion_detection), x_6 (social_media_sentiment_detection). Theme: Sentiment-related classification tasks.
Cluster 2 (S_2): x_2 (spam_detection), x_5 (junk_mail_detection). Theme: Detection of unwanted messages.

Step 3: Aggregate Frequencies
F_1 = 10 + 2 + 2 = 14 -> Label: "sentiment_analysis"
F_2 = 3 + 10 = 13 -> Label: "spam_detection"
F_3 = 4 + 8 = 12 -> Label: "event_classification"

Step 4: Optimization Result

"""

quant_depth_instruction = lambda node, candidate_subtopics, ancestors: f"""You are attempting to identify subtopics for parent topic, {node.label}, that best represent and partition a pool of papers. A subtopic is a specific division within a broader category that organizes related items or concepts more precisely.
We define {node.label} (a type of {node.dimension}) as: {node.description}
The path to parent node, "{node.label}", in the taxonomy is: {ancestors}.

You have the following candidate subtopics with their corresponding number of papers:

{candidate_subtopics}


Given the parent node, an input set of candidate subtopics and their dimension type (e.g., either a task, methodology, dataset, real_world_domain, or evaluation_method) as reference, can you identify the non-overlapping cluster subtopics of parent {node.dimension} topic {node.label} that best represent and partition all of the candidates above (maximize the number of papers that are mapped to each). They should all be siblings of each other (same level of depth/specificity) within the taxonomy (no cluster subtopic should fall under another cluster subtopic)? Each new cluster topic that you suggest should be a more specific subtopic under the parent topic node, {node.label}, and be a type of task. However, they should all be equally unique (non-duplicates) and no single paper should be able to fall into both clusters easily.

Treat this as a quantitative clustering (optimization) problem. Select subtopics that MINIMIZE the TOTAL NUMBER of subtopics needed yet simultaneously MAXIMIZE the number of total papers mapped (where the maximum value possible is the total number of papers). In the tags <quantitative_reasoning></quantitative_reasoning>, explain your quantitative reasoning, using the candidate subtopics as variables with their integer values equal to the number of papers mapped to the respective topics. REMEMBER that all candidate subtopics under a cluster you form SHOULD BE RELATED.

depth_cluster_system_instruction = """You are an clusterer that is performing taxonomy depth expansion, which is defined as adding subcategory nodes deeper to a given root_topic node, these being children concepts/topics which EXCLUSIVELY fall under the specified parent node and not the parent\'s siblings. For example, given a taxonomy of NLP tasks, expanding "text_classification" depth-wise (where its siblings are [\"named_entity_recognition\", \"machine_translation\", and \"question_answering\"]) would create the children nodes, [\"sentiment_analysis\", \"spam_detection\", and \"document_classification\"] (any suitable number of children). On the other hand, \"open_domain_question_answering\" SHOULD NOT be added as it belongs to sibling, \"question_answering\".

You are choosing your new subtopic clusters based on which subtopics of the parent topic are covered by papers that discuss the parent node. Your job is to identify unique clusters formed from the input set of paper topics. For each cluster you identify, you must provide a cluster name (in similar format to the paper_topics) as its key, a 1 sentence description of the cluster name, and a list of all the input paper_topics covered within the cluster."""

</input>

What are the primary sub-{node.dimension} topic clusters under the parent_node topic, {node.label}, that would best encompass the above <paper_topics>?
These should be non-overlapping topic clusters that best represent and partition all of paper_topics (maximize the number of papers that are mapped to each). They should all be siblings (same level of depth/specificity) under the parent_node within the taxonomy. Each new cluster topic that you suggest should be a more specific subtopic under the parent_node, {node.label}, and be a type of {node.dimension}. However, they should all be equally unique (non-duplicates) and no single paper should be able to fall into both clusters easily.\n
